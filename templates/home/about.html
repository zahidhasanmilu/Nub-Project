    <p class="mt-1">
        Keeping in step with the rapidly increasing demand for higher education, the Government of the People’s Republic
        of Bangladesh passed the Private Universities Act in 1992 which has been revised and replaced by Private
        University Act 2010. Following the1992 the Act, Bangladesh witnessed a sudden flux of private universities with
        the promise to provide higher education to students that will be at par with global standards.

    <p class="mt-3">
        In 2002, a group of eminent academics recognized this exponential increase in demand and established Northern
        University Bangladesh on 17 October in order to bring quality education within the reach of students with modest
        economic means. Sponsored and founded by International Business Agriculture & Technology (IBAT) Trust now known
        as NUB Trust (NUBT), a registered, non-political, non-profit voluntary organization, NUB made its foray in to
        the field of higher education and established itself as a center for excellence. <br> <br>

        Presently Northern University Bangladesh (NUB) has 5 Faculties situated within the Dhaka Metropolitan city with
        its Permanent Campus near Haji camp at Ashkona, Dakshin Khan. NUB has affiliations & accreditations with
        international institutions in its effort to provide education that can provide students with all the tools
        needed to face the challenges in any chosen career from any specialized field & the global industry. NUB has
        been authorized to confer degrees and certificates in all branches of knowledge including Business, Arts &
        Humanities, Science and Engineering, Law, Pharmacy and Public Health within the levels that includes Bachelors,
        Masters & is in the process of acquiring the level of M Phil & Ph. D. in collaboration with foreign
        universities.<br> <br>

        Northern University Bangladesh is now owned and managed by a group of academics under the illustrious and
        reputable banner of NUB Trust, who intend to not only provide higher education to the deserving students with
        moderate means but also aims to mould individuals with a specific skill set along with the value of social
        responsibility. Northern University Bangladesh believes in building a better future for the citizens of
        Bangladesh by enhancing its socio-economic empowerment. <br> <br>
